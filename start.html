<div class="content">
			<p>&emsp; &emsp;Perform all the postures slowly and with control. You are not in competition
with anyone, not even yourself. You'll progress faster when you take things
slowly.

❖ Concentrate on your breathing, feel the air slowly flowing through your body,
relaxing and energizing it.

❖ Relax. Let go of any unnecessary tension, stress or negative thoughts.
<BR>
❖ Start every session with the warm-up. It's essential to avoid injuries.
<BR>
❖ Modify the postures for your body. The instructions and pictures of the yoga
postures in this book are the final goal - the direction you are going towards, not
where you need to be after your first few sessions. Experiment and explore
different positions and alignments to make the posture work for your body.
<br>
❖ Don't expect instant results. Yoga is a not a quick fix for your weight
problems. Patience is a key to unlocking the long-term slimming benefits of
Yoga.
<br>
❖ Have Fun! The best way to get results with your Yoga practice is to enjoy it.
Feeling happy while practicing Yoga puts the mind and body into a positive
state.
<br>
❖ Most Importantly, listen to and respect your body. Never force any movement.
Let your body lead you, it is your greatest teacher!</p>
