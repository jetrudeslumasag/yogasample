			<button type="button" class="collapsible">YOGA HISTORY</button>
			<div class="content">
			<p>&emsp; &emsp;Most of us know yoga as a set of poses performed in a gym or yoga studio setting. The majority of
yoga styles practiced today were invented in the last quarter of the 20th century and are either a far
cry from yoga’s roots or have no authentic lineage.
If we really want to examine the roots of yoga, we need to go back to the Harrapan culture, dating
back 3,500 years, when yoga was a meditative practice. According to some, around 1500 BCE,
Harrapan culture was diminished due to Aryan invasion. Barbarians from Normandy introduced the
caste system and enforced a set of religious rituals that involved blood sacrifice practices. Along
with these religious practices came sacred scriptures called the Vedas, a large body of spiritual texts
originating in India.
<br><br>
&emsp; &emsp;The word “yoga” was first mentioned in the oldest of the Vedas, Rig Veda. It
referred to the concept of discipline.
Fast forward to 800 BCE. The Upanishads, a collection of texts that contain some of the earliest
concepts of Hinduism, prescribed the method of achieving enlightenment by studying under a teacher
and dedicating one’s life to a yoga practice.
<br>
The Upanishads outlined two paths to enlightenment:
Karma Yoga (selfless dedication to the service of others) and Jnana Yoga (intense study of spiritual
writings). Around the 3rd century BCE, the Maitrayaniya Upanishad prescribed a six-step process to
enlightenment, which included mastering pranayama (breath control), pratyaharia (sense
withdrawal), dhyana (meditation), dharana (one-pointed concentration), tarka (self-reflection), and
samadhi (absolute absorption) in order to unite the Atman (individual’s spirit) and Brahman
(universal spirit or source of creation). The sacred syllable om appeared in this particular Upanishad
as a symbol of union between mind and breath.
<br>
<br>
&emsp; &emsp;At around the same time that Maitrayaniya Upanishad was introduced, Bhagavad Gita gained
prominence. This scripture combined and mythological tales that later made their way into a
celebrated collection of tales, Mahabharata. Three methods of devotion were outlined inBhagavad
Gita: Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Bhakti Yoga (devotion).
Compiled around 400 CE by Patanjali, The Yoga Sutras introduced the eight-fold path to yoga
practice, which is considered to be the classical yoga manual and the foundation of many of today’s
yoga practices, particularly Ashtanga Yoga. We will hear more about this eight-fold path in The Eight
Limbs of Yoga (here), which include yama (self-restraint) niyama (self-purification by self-restraint
and discipline), asana (seat or posture), pranayama (control of breath), pratyahara (sense
withdrawal), dharana (one-pointed concentration), dhyana (meditation), and samadhi (total
absorption).
<br>
<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Around the 4th century CE, Tantra Yoga emerged. This new form of yoga celebrated the physical body
as a vehicle to enlightenment. The philosophy behind Tantra Yoga can be summarized by the idea of
uniting all the dualities within a human body (e.g., male and female; good and evil), which gave
Tantra a very sexual reputation. This is, however, a common misunderstanding, since Tantra practices
extend far beyond sexuality.
<br>
Hatha Yoga was introduced in the 10th century CE. It combined the physicality and conscious intent of
using bodily postures, or asana practice, and pranayama breath control for the goal of selfrealization.
In 14th century CE, the Yoga Upanishads were introduced. One of these sacred texts, Tejo Bindu
Upanishad, added seven more important parts of yoga practice on top of Patanjali’s eight. They were
as follows: mula bandha (root lock), balance, undisturbed vision, tyaga (abandonment), mauua
(quiet), desha (space), and kala (time).
<br>
<br>
&emsp; &emsp;It was not until the 20th century that yoga gained any kind of popularity in Western Europe and North
America. Swami Sivananda Saraswati was one of the first yogis to travel outside of India to spread
the teachings of yoga to the West. He established yoga centers in North America at the time Swami
Satchidananda also delivered an opening speech at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. However, T.
Krishnamacharya is arguably the father of the yoga practice with which Westerners are familiar
today. In the 1930s, he began teaching his students the Mysore vigorous sequences of yoga poses that
emphasize strength and athletic ability. Students were only allowed to learn the next and more
challenging pose after they had grasped the previous one. His three most prominent and influential
students are Pattabhi Jois, Iyengar, and Indra Devi.
<br>
<br>
&emsp; &emsp;Pattabhi Jois established Ashtanga yoga. It is one
of the most popular types of yoga practiced in the West. Iyengar became successful by creating his
own sequences of yoga poses, which were characterized by a focus on the alignment of the body and
the use of various props. Indra Devi is considered the first famous yogini (female yoga master).
Krishnamacharya also educated his son Desikachar in yoga. An engineer by training, Desikachar saw
great value in studying yoga only when he was already a college graduate. Desikachar developed
Vinyoga, which is a more therapeutic and less intense approach to physical practice, as compared to
Ashtanga.
<br> <br>
&emsp; &emsp;The 21st century presents us with an endless variety of yoga “styles” or “brands,” such as Bikram
Yoga, Power Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, and countless more. It is important to be open-minded, try as
many styles and approaches as possible, and figure out what gives you the best results in terms of
achieving both your physical and spiritual goals. There is no wrong way to achieve self-realization.
Just make sure you are mindful, patient, practical, and consistent in your practice.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">WHEN TO PRACTICE</button>
<div class="content">
	<p1>&emsp; &emsp;Put aside a specific time in your day to enjoy your Yoga practice. Dawn and dusk are
considered the best times of the day to practice Yoga, as the rising and setting of the sun
charge our body with special energy. However, if these times are impossible for you, find
another time of the day that works best for you and practice consistently.
Practice in the morning if you want to prepare your mind and body for the day, and
charge your body with positive energy. Keep in mind that in the morning or in cold weather
your muscles will be stiffer, so ease carefully into the postures at first.
Practice in the evening if you want to relax after a stressful day, unwind and centre. In the
evenings your body will be more flexible, so you'll be able to go deeper into postures.</p1>	
</div>
</div>
					
<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">WHERE TO PRACTICE</button>
			<div class="content">
	<p2> &emsp; &emsp;	Find a place where you are least likely to be disturbed. It can be your room, garden or
beach - indoors or outdoors, wherever there is an even, flat surface.
If you are practicing indoors, make sure that the room is ventilated and with comfortable
temperature. Air conditioned rooms are not advisable - when the environment is cold your
body is stiff, and muscles stretch slowly. A clean environment and fresh air adds additional
benefits to the breathing practice.
Make sure that you have enough space to allow you to move around, and extend the
arms and legs freely. Turn your phone off and hang a note on your door to say that you
are having time to yourself. This is YOUR time.</p2>	
</div>
</div>
					
<div>
	<button type="button" class="collapsible">EATING AND DRINKING</button>
		<div class="content">
	<p2>&emsp; &emsp;Never practice directly after eating. Yoga should be done on empty stomach.
Therefore allow at least 1 hour after a snack and 2 - 3 hours after a heavy meal before
you begin your practice.
It is best to drink before or after your Yoga session, to avoid becoming dehydrated. Try to
avoid drinking water during the practice, to avoid losing your concentration on Yoga
postures and breathing.
However if you are practicing in the morning, have at least a glass of warm water before
your practice, or a light snack (fruit or yoghurt). When you finish your practice eat a
proper breakfast.</p2>	
</div>
</div>
					
<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">WHAT TO WEAR</button>
		<div class="content">
	<p2>&emsp; &emsp;Wear comfortable, light, loose clothing, preferably made of natural fibers. Your clothes
should not restrict your movements. Remove your jewelry, watch and spectacles if
possible.
Yoga is practiced with bare feet. </p2>	
</div>
</div>
					
<div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">WHAT YOU NEED</button>
	<div class="content">
	<p2>&emsp; &emsp;Get a special Yoga mat for yourself. It provides padding as well as a non-slip surface to
practice on, and makes your practice easier and safer. You can find one in any sports
shop.
No one else should use your mat. This is not only for hygiene reasons, but also because
you will eventually build up energy on your mat that will support you throughout the Yoga
practice.
You can also get a cushion to make your meditation more comfortable and a blanket if
you wish to cover yourself while relaxing in the Corpse Pose at the end of the session.
If you want, you can play relaxing, soothing music in the background - just make sure itʼs
not too loud. </p2>
